## Vercel Web Analytics Configuration - Implementation Report

### What Was Implemented

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js project using the App Router (app directory).

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Analytics Import to Root Layout
**File:** `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Added the `<Analytics />` component inside the body tag (inside the Column component), positioned after the Footer component
- This ensures analytics tracking is applied globally to all pages

#### 2. Removed Duplicate Analytics from Home Page
**File:** `src/app/page.tsx`
- Removed the import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
- Removed the `<Analytics />` component from the Home page to avoid duplication
- Kept the SpeedInsights component which provides performance metrics

### Package Status

The `@vercel/analytics` package was already installed in the project (v1.6.1), so no installation was required. The package.json and package-lock.json did not need to be modified.

### Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ **Build Verification**: Ran `npm run build` - Successfully compiled with no errors
2. ✅ **Linting**: Ran biome formatter - All formatting issues resolved
3. ✅ **Code Quality**: Verified no TypeScript or React errors in modified files
4. ✅ **Architecture**: Confirmed proper placement of Analytics component in root layout following Next.js best practices

### Implementation Details

- **Router Type**: App Router (Next.js 16.0.10)
- **Component Location**: Root layout file at `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Placement**: Inside the `<body>` element (Column component), after Footer component but within Providers
- **Global Coverage**: Analytics now tracks all pages automatically

### Best Practices Applied

- Analytics component is placed in the root layout, not individual pages, ensuring single-point configuration
- Follows Next.js App Router conventions for global components
- Maintains clean separation of concerns by centralizing analytics setup
- No duplicate analytics tracking across pages

### Build Output

Production build completed successfully:
- ✓ Compiled successfully in 29.5s
- All 29 static and dynamic pages generated
- No TypeScript errors
- All routes properly configured
